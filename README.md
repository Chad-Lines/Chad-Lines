<h1> Hi, I'm Chad. Welcome to my Github Profile <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35px"></h1>

<p><strong>Hi, I'm Chad.</strong> I'm a <strong>tech professional</strong> with over a <emphasis>decade</emphasis> of experience in technology leadership, with an emphasis on coaching and mentoring others while being focused on results and improvement.</p>
<p>I'm a <strong>tinkerer by nature</strong>; I love inspecting code, taking things apart, and putting it back together in new ways. The projects and experiences that I value the most are the ones that have allowed me to stretch and test my abilities, to learn and discover new things!</p>
