<h1> Hi, I'm Chad. Welcome to my Github Profile</h1>

<p><strong>Hi, I'm Chad.</strong> I'm a <strong>tech professional</strong> with over a <emphasis>decade</emphasis> of experience in project management, data analysis, and programming.</p>

<p>I'm a <strong>tinkerer by nature</strong>; I love playing with code, and building things that are useful or fun (or both). The projects and experiences that I value the most are the ones that have allowed me to stretch and test my abilities, to learn and discover new things!</p>

<p>I'm also a <strong>passionate teacher</strong>. One of the things that I love about learning is being able to turn around and share what I've learned with others. I love seeing people find something that they're passionate about, and watch as they "leave the nest" to begin exploring and tinkering on their own.
